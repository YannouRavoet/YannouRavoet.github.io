    <h3>I am currently studying Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence at KU Leuven, Belgium.<br>
        My thesis for this master is the extension of the General Game Playing framework with stochastic actions
        as well as the implementation of a Python framework for the development of general game players.<br>
        I previously finished a Master of Electronics and ICT Engineering Technology: Internet Computing at the same university,
        where my thesis was a user study on the effectiveness of different player guidance techniques in motion-based games.<br>
        As you can probably tell, I enjoy researching, developing and playing with artificial intelligence in various challenges
        such as <a href="https://blog.raccoons.be/unforgettable-internship-brainjar">building a classifier for Dutch Sign Language Video's </a>,
        <a href="https://vimeo.com/327167924"> building a DeepFake of a news reporter and showing it to him </a> and
        <a href="https://yannouravoet.github.io/gymprojects/"> applying increasing levels of Reinforcement Learning to various simple games </a>.<br>
        Don't hesitate to shoot me message if you want to meet!
